        my name is Simon Shamoon and I am a rising junior at Arizona State
        University double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
        <br />
        <br />
        My hobbies include programming, studying mathematics (specifically
        graphs), occasionally
        running, and playing Dota 2.

        <br />
        this project was inspired by an "extra credit" assignment in the Gap
        Learning Experience during the data science portion of the program. i
        was already trying to learn full-stack development so i thought "why
        not?" and to try and build my first React web app from scratch. this is also my first project dealing with data science, so I knocked two birds with one stone.
